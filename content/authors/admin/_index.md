I am a PhD student in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to have [Elaine Shi](http://elaineshi.com/) as my advisor.

Previously, I was a research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.html), hosted by [Kai-Min Chung](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/). Before that, I was a blockchain researcher at DEXON foundation. I got my master's degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, and I got my bachelor's degree from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I majored in physics and minored in philosophy.
